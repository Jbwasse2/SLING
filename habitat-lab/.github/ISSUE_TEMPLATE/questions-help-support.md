## Habitat-Lab and Habitat-Sim versions
Habitat-Lab: vx.x.x or master?

Habitat-Sim: vx.x.x or master?

Habitat is under active development, and we advise users to restrict themselves to stable releases. Are you using the latest release versions of [Habitat-Lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab/releases) and [Habitat-Sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases)? Your question may already be addressed in the latest versions. We may also not be able to help with problems in earlier versions because they sometimes lack the more verbose logging needed for debugging.

Master branch contains 'bleeding edge' code and should be used at your own risk.
