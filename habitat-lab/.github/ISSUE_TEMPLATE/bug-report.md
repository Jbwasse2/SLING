Habitat is under active development, and we advise users to restrict themselves to stable releases of [Habitat-Lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab/releases) and [Habitat-Sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases). The bug you are about to report may already be fixed in the latest version.

Master branch contains 'bleeding edge' code, but we do appreciate bug reports for it!
